# VR-TutorialGame

## Abstract

This repository contains two major structures inside a same project. First a simple VR scene built based on [this tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM0k2n7u8sc&list=PLpEoiloH-4eP-OKItF8XNJ8y8e1asOJud) to learn basic VR capabilities using the Unity game engine. And second, the evolution to a simple VR game to expand on the concepts learned on the tutorial series.

The initial configuration for the Unity project was made based on [this tutorial for setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxMzAw2Sg5w).
